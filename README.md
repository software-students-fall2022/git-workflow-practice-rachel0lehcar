## Why I Find this Article Interesting
This article is about what exactly software engineering do. It discusses how software engineers do more that simply write code, but how they also depend on design, data science and project manajment. I found this article interesting because it generally reiterated the description of what software engineering is in class. Similarly it talks about the presence of a little ambiguity in the differences between roles. Some companies may refer the the same dob description with different names, but ultimitaly they fall under the same development umbrella.

## Comment by Leah Durrett

I was skeptical when I saw the question “what’s the difference between a developer, engineer, and developer?” because we have already established that they are essentially the same but the article does indeed confirm this. The article did a decent job at presenting the usefulness of being a software developer and even mentioned that being a software developer can help the world. I beg to differ that changing the world depends on the type of developer you become.
